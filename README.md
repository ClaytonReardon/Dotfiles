# Dotfiles
My various config files. Made for a system running i3 Window Manager.

Config contains dotfiles for GTK, i3, Kitty, Neovim, Picom, Polybar, Rofi, and Terminator, as well as an autostart script.

Themes contains my WIP GTK theme based on the [Srcery](https://github.com/srcery-colors) color pallete.

And obviosuly, my .zshrc.
